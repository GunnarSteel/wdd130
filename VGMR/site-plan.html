        Video games aren’t just a way for entertainment, they also possess the capability to expand our brain’s memory retention. Some of these capabilities allow us to do our day-to-day jobs better. The ways video games help with memory retention are with problem-solving and puzzles. These memory builders are only just a few that help those who play video games today. There are so many more ways that video games help us with memory retention that I might add on later.

      <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
      <p>
        Each time we are presented with a problem-solving condition within a game we must decide what the best path is for our character. Each path can be different swaying the way our game ends. Problem solving helps our brains memory retention by creating those scenarios and allowing us to play them in our head on how we want to play. This helps our memory because it allows us to look back on different decisions, good and bad allowing us to change the path to best fit our circumstance in the real world.

      <h3>Puzzles</h3>
      <p>
        Puzzles within video games help us within our lives and with our memory by creating and improving a skill that is used in many different environments. Many of these environments include School, work, and social spaces. This skill of solving puzzles help individuals navigate through different situations and allow our brains to create a map of our surroundings that you are able to piece together so that you do not get lost.
