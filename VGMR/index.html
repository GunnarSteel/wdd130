            <h2>Video games aren’t just a way for entertainment, they also possess the capability to expand our brain’s memory retention. Some of these capabilities allow us to do our day-to-day jobs better. The ways video games help with memory retention are with problem-solving and puzzles. These memory builders are only just a few that help those who play video games today. Every video game has its own strong point that it works on. Each one of those points helps with our brain’s memory and increases the capacity of our memory. There are so many more ways that video games help us with memory retention that I might add on later.</h2>
